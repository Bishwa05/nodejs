/**
 * The primary use of nextTick in a function is to postpone the broadcast of result events to listeners on the current execution stack until the caller has had an opportunity to register event listenersâ€”to give the currently executing program
a chance to bind callbacks to EventEmitter.emit events. It may be thought of as a pattern used wherever asynchronous behavior should be emulated.
